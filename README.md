# ProFlow

This is a hydraulics project powered by javascript, html and css. The developed
application computes flow characteristics of rectangular, triangular and
trapezoidal sections under uniform, rapidly varied and gradually varied
flow conditions. This project was developed as an approach to an undergraduate hydraulics assignment in civil engineering.
